# MultiCollinearity-in-Logistic-regression
In regression, "multicollinearity" refers to predictors that are correlated with other predictors.
Multicollinearity occurs when your model includes multiple factors that are correlated not just to your response variable, but also to each other.
In other words, it results when you have factors that are a bit redundant
